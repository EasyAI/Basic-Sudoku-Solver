# Basic Sudoku Solver

## Description
A basic sudoku solver using a simple algorithm, the algorithm uses a mask to find out which box should have a value input. This is done first by taking a block of 9 boxes, finding out the values in the adjacent boxes and then building a mask that will be used to detemin where to store a value.

## Usage
As this is just basic you will only beable to run simple puzzles (ones with only 1 possible solution). Also you would need to go into the the script and add the table automatically. I hope to automate this and also allow for complex puzzles to be solvable in the future.
